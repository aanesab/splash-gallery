          If asked, most people would probably say that modern art is not true
          to reality. Indeed, modern art is practically defined by its bizarre
          distortions of reality; this is one reason why Norman Rockwell, whose
          work is more recent than Umberto Boccioni's, is not considered a
          modern artist. But looking like reality- what art historians call
          "naturalism"- is only one way pf being true to reality. As we shall
          see, the attempt to create art that was more true to reality than
          traditional naturalism was the motivation for some of the most radical
          modern art, even including Boccioni's States of Mind: The Farewells.

        <h2>Impressionism and optical realism</h2>
        <p>
          When the Impressionist style first appeared on the art scene of the
          1870's, many hostile viewers dismissed it as art by "lunatics" whose
          color perception was questionable and who did not have the techical
          skills to properly finish their paintings. Some critics claimed,
          however, that Impressionists paintings were more accurate than
          traditional naturalistic representations. Their argument was that the
          Impressionists represented their perception of objects rather than the
          objects themselves, and that the colors we percieve are often not
          identical to an object's actual or "local" color.
        </p>
        <img
          style="width: 80%"
          src="images/a-2.jpg"
          alt="Left: Claude Monet, Rouen Cathedral (The Portal and the Tour d’Albane in full Sunlight) also called Harmony in Blue and Gold, painted 1893, dated 1894, oil on canvas, 107 x 73 cm (Musée d’Orsay); Right: Rouen Cathedral, Portal, Morning sun, 1893, oil on canvas, 92.2 x 63.0 (Musée d’Orsay"
        />
        <p>
          In the 1890s, Monet created dozens of paintings of Rouen Cathedral at
          different times of day in different weather. At dawn, the cathedral
          was tinged with blue light; in the late afternoon, it was radiant with
          oranges and yellows; while on cloudy days it was duller grayish tan.
          By recording how the appearances of objects are affected by different
          lighting conditions, the Impressionists argued that their paintings
          were more accurate representations of the way we see the world. What
          appears at first sight to be a radically unrealistic style is in fact
          more true to the way things actually look.

        <h2>Discarding artificial conventions</h2>

        />
        <p>
          The Impressionists recognized that much traditional art was accepted
          as true to reality only because it was familiar, not because it was
          accurate. For example, methods of composition taught in Academies
          tended to emphasize a central focus, equal balance on both sides, and
          clear depiction of spatial recession, as in David's Oath of the
          Horatii. Such compositions are, in fact, very artificially staged.
          When we move through the world, we are more likely to encounter scenes
          like the one represented in Degas's The Race Track: awkwardly
          unbalanced, abruptly cropped, and spatially ambigous. Critics who
          supported the Impressionists argued that artists like Degas were
          correcting artificial conventions and making art more true to reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the Impressionist style was new, this form of argument was
          not. In the sixteenth century artists and critics tried to draw a
          distinction between a true naturalism and a false naturalism (often
          derogatorily called "Mannerism"). False naturalism involved copying
          the work of other artists, and thus understanding nature only at
          second hand. The solution, some felt, was to discard the conventions
          of art and return to a more careful study of the original source,
          nature itself, just as the Impressionists did.

        <h2>Is naturalism true to nature?</h2>
        <p>
          Impressionist artists sought greater truth to nature through more
          careful observation, but there is a sense in which our eyes inevitably
          distort the objects they percieve. Three ways they do so are embodied
          in the artistic thechniques of linear perspective, diminution, and
          foreshortening.
        </p>
        <img style="width: 100%;"

        />
        <p>
          In linear perspective, wat are actually parallel lines in real life
          (such as railroad tracks or the edges of the floor tiles) converge in
          the representation. This effect, seen above in the Seanredam painting
          of a church interior, is integral to what is popularly considered a
          realistic style, but it is obviously not true to reality. Each of the
          tiles on the floor is in fact square. Similiarly, with diminution,
          objects appear to get smaller the farther away we are, but this is
          just an optical trick; each of those windows is in reality the same
          size.
        </p>
        <p>
          Foreshortening occurs when we view an object from an angle at which it
          recedes away from us, so that the object appears to be contracted,
          shorter than its actual length. In the Academic figure study above on
          the right, the two thighs appear to be different lengths and shapes
          simply becauseone is viewed parallel to the actua reality, of course,
          both thighs are very similar (mirror images) in lengths and shapes.

        <h2>Correcting for perceptual distortion</h2>
        <p>
          The style we colloquially call "realistic" is not literally true to
          reality, then. It is only a record of our perception of reality, from
          one angle, at one distance, at one moment in time, and in one kind of
          light, and all of these factors can distort the object. Some Modern
          art movements sought a representational system that would be more
          accurate to the true shapes of objects, rather than representing them
          deformed by perception.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          Cubist painitngs seem at first sight to be even more bizarrely
          distorted and unrealistic than Impressionist paintings. In the Saloon
          Cubist Jean Metzinger's Le Gouter, objects appear to be twisted and
          broken up, but this is done in order to correct the distortions of the
          perspective and foreshortening. Metzinger shows things from multiple
          perspectives so we can better understand their true shapes. The left
          side of the tea cup on the table is seen from the side at eye level,
          but from that angle you wouldn't be able to tell that the cup has a
          round opening, so the right side is seen from above to complete our
          understanding of the round lip and concave shape of the cup.
          Similiarly, one of the woman's eyes is viewd in profile, while the
          other is seen facing us, and her left shoulder is seen from above,
          while the right is more straight on. Cubism doesn't "distort" objects;
          it shows them from multiple angles in order to give us more
          information about their true shapes that would be visible in
          traditional naturalistic representation.

        <h2>Modernism and science</h2>
        <p>
          Another way of justifying the apparent distortions of modern art came
          in the form of appeals to science. Modern science provided a stream of
          new images that sparked artists' imaginations, as well as new theories
          that radically altered people's understanding of reality.

          Beginning in the seventeenth century, new technologies based on the
          use of optical lenses provided evidence of microscopic and macroscopic
          worlds hitherto unsuspected. The discovery of wavelengths beyond the
          visible spectrum, including infrared and ultraviolet light as well as
          x-rays, gamma rays, and radio waves, made it clear that the human
          senses are very limited instruments for understanding the objective
          world. The visual culture of modern science provided new ways of
          representing and understanding reality. Stop-motion photography made
          rapid actions visible for study, and x-ray photography allowed peeks
          into the interior of solid forms, resulting in visions of reality
          beyond traditional naturalism.

        />
        <p>
          One work that attempted to represent this new super-sensory reality
          was Italian Futurist Umberto Boccioni's States of Mind: The Farewells
          (1911). The only clearly legible feature in the painting is the number
          6943 stenciled on what we gradually discern is the engine of a
          dark-gray train engine spewing steam in a station. The train is
          represented, Cubist-fashion, from multiple perspectives. The nose cone
          is in profile, while the body of the train recedes in a zig-zag toward
          the upper right then upper center of the canvas. In front of the train
          in green are a series of a couples saying goodbye (their two heads and
          embracing arms are clearest in the lower left) — or perhaps they are
          one couple, viewed multiple times in the manner of stop-action
          photography in order to show motion through time.

          Two truss structures on the left suggest the radio towers that were
          constructed across Europe in the first decades of the twentieth
          century after the Italian Guglielmo Marconi harnessed radio waves for
          wireless communication. Correspondingly, the remainder of the
          composition is permeated with wave-forms in bright colors to suggest
          their high energy. Many forms of electromagnetic energy such as radio
          waves are invisible to the eye, but nonetheless permeate the world.
          Altogether, the work makes visible the new understanding of nature
          achieved by modern physics and presents a glimpse of reality beyond
          the limitations of the human senses.

        <h2>Modernism and spiritualism</h2>
        <p>
          Modern artists' quest for truth to realities beyond human perception
          was also influenced by the explicitly non-scientific approaches of
          spiritualism. Although spiritual visions and discoveries are often
          seen as subjective, many modern artists saw them as revealing
          objective truths. They claimed their depictions of these discoveries
          were glimpses of a higher reality than that available to the human
          senses.

        />
        <p>
          The Swedish artist Hilma af Klint painted a series of works called The
          Paintings for the Temple between 1905 and 1915 based in part on
          mystical visions she received from a spiritual guide. Around the same
          time, the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian undertook a close study of nature
          to eventually discover what he felt were the basic “building blocks”
          of all natural and artistic form: the primary colors red, yellow, and
          blue; the primary values black and white, and horizontal and vertical
          lines. Although both of these artists produced some artworks that are
          entirely non-representational in the sense that they do not look like
          nature, both argued that their spiritual quest revealed a higher
          reality than that available to the senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          These artists all remind us that what is popularly considered
          ”realistic” in art is in fact only based on sense perceptions, which
          are inevitably partial, and which in many cases distort reality. By
          observing nature more closely, discarding artificial conventions,
          correcting for perceptual distortions, absorbing new scientific
          theories, and engaging in spiritual investigations, many modern
          artists rejected traditional naturalism in order to seek higher
          truths.
